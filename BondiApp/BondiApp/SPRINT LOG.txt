We will use this document for sprints so it is contained within the project.

04.10.18 Sprint:   
1.	Modify the Entity Model so that we can make edits without having to do it via bash or shell commands.
2.	Need help with polling the tickprice when a buy order only is placed.  What could happen is we have a BUY TO OPEN order placed at say $49.50.
	poll the tick price to determine if the stock is running up.  If it is we need to know pnce it crosses the opening price plus the index.width 
	in this case it would be $0.25 or $49.75.  Once that occurs we need to modify the BUY TO OPEN order up by the index.width (twenty-five cents).
	This action would trail the run up until such time as that BUY TO OPEN order is filled.
3.	Need help thinking through the logic of a gap down or gap up and determine if the code handles that.  If there is a gap up we should fill 
	any SELL TO CLOSE orders whereby the opening Gap Up in price would be above.  If the stock gaps down we would have the existing BUY TO OPEN 
	order filled but not anything new opened lower than that.  NOTE: This happens at the market open for 99.9% of the time.

Targeted Spring Completion:  Wednesday April 12, 2018.
